## Description
This service allows customers to easily manage subscription services as well as payments. We aim to make ETH payment one of the main payment methods in the future.

## Current Challenges
There is a limited number of services that accept ETH as payment. Our goal is to facilitate the use of ETH for everyday transactions, making it simple to pay for the content and services that we typically purchase. We envision a future where people can seamlessly buy and sell products and services with ETH, beyond just Defi, NFTs, and similar applications.

## Features
Manage subscriptions for web2, web3, and creators in a unified platform
Real-time notification using PushProtocol
The ability to track and notify subscription renewals and payment information in real-time using Superfluid
User authentication using Worldcoin, which increases security and transparency
